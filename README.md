# Project Overview


## Project Description

DMB stands for Developers Mental Break where you come to for programming jokes, programming inspirational quotes, and get facts on random numbers.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## API Snippet

programming random quotes: https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/quotes/random
Numbers random facts: http://numbersapi.com/4
```

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page
- Create components
- React Router
- Create the logic: 
    - Keep track of votes to display top votes
    - Also display the latest quotes added
- Style it

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Share on social media platforms

## React Component Hierarchy

On the App.js file, I will have state define and have componets in side home component.
See images on top.

## Priority Matrix

Add in a picture of your Priority Matrix - See images on top. 

## Functional Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will render the Home and Layout| 
| Home | This will render the remaining component | 
| Top | This will render the inputs of users | 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |


## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.
